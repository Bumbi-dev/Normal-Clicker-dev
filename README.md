MiniGame - Buy or Die
You have 100 seconds to figure it out. You have to buy an item costing 100 clicks, but when you reach 90
it increases proportionally to your clicks. When there are 5 seconds remaining clicks are reset to 100, but 
the price stays the same and this time it doesn't go up. If you manage to buy it you get the good ending, else
you get the bad one.
